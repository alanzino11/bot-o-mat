Hello!

For my bot-o-mat project I decided to create a React app. I also made a github page for the application, which can be found at https://alanzino11.github.io/bot-o-mat/.

To get started with the app:

Go inside the project's main folder by doing: $ cd bot-o-mat

If you haven't already, install Node from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ .

Run $ npm install to install the dependencies needed for React (listed in the package.json file).

Do $ npm start inside you're terminal to start up the React development server.
