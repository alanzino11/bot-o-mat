Hello! ðŸ¤–

For my bot-o-mat project I decided to create a React app. I also made a github page for the application, which can be found at https://alanzino11.github.io/bot-o-mat/.

To get started with the app:

install Node from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

after downloading, enter the project by doing $ cd bot-o-mat

run $ npm i to install the necessary dependencies

finally, run $ npm start to open up the server!

enjoy :)
